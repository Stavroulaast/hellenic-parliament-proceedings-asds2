## Analyzing Government Rhetoric in Greek Parliamentary Proceedings (2010â€“2020)

This project analyzes rhetorical style in Greek parliamentary speeches between 2010â€“2020, with a focus on emotional tone, linguistic complexity, and semantic change over time. It adapts methods from computational social science to a non-English, highly inflected language â€” Greek â€” using custom preprocessing and representation techniques.
